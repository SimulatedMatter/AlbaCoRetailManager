# AlbaCoRetailManager
A retail management system based on the TimCo Retail Management Course. This project is designed to simulate a real-world contract between a client and a software development services company. This project incorporates multiple technologies which change over time to meet additional requirements made by the "client". The purpose of this course is to teach students how multiple technologies fit together in the real-world.
